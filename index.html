Bg is set to dark meaning the background is dark. Navbar dark makes the text light, because the navbar is dark-->
      <div class="container"> <!--The container makes it so that the branding is contained to a certain limit inside of the navbar-->

Bg dark makes the background dark and the text light makes the text lighter (obvious). And p-5 adds a padding of 5 pixels on the section. The text-center just centers the text in the middle-->
      <div class="container pt-5"> <!--Container to make sure the contents don't press up against the edge, adding padding top of 5 because the navbar was covering my content-->
        <div class="d-sm-flex"> <!--The flex turns the two elements below, the heading and image, into a flex row (so they are in the same row). The sm specifies that the flex will only activate with sizes bigger than the small screen size-->
